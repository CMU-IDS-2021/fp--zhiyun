Active Learning is a special case in Machine Learning that starts with a small number
of data points, and interactively suggest new instances to evaluate, and aims to
maximize the performance metrics of the model using as few as possible data poin ts.
Bayesian Optimization is an efficient way to optimize a black box function faster by
suggesting new parameters based on the prior knowledge of evaluated data. These
two techniques can help with training a regression model on or maximize/minimize a
blac k box function in different areas of scientific research. The application BOARD
Bay esian Optimization and Active Regression Dashboard built in the project is a
dashboard where researchers who are not familiar with running Bayesian Optimization
or Active Learning experiments programmaticall y can complete the tasks i n an
interactive and user friendly way.

## Introduction
*  **Gaussian Process**

![Gaussian Process](https://planspace.org/20181226-gaussian_processes_are_not_so_fancy/img/predictive_mean_and_range.png)

Gaussian Process regression is a commonly used model to approximate black-box functions based on prior knowledge and to make predictions in the unknown area with uncertainty.
*  **Bayesian Optimization**

In scientific research, optimization of measurements by tuning parameters and
regression model training are two common problems. In many experiments, there are
multiple design parameters (or independent variables) that can take multiple or even
i nfinite number s of values, which makes the searching space very large and hence an
exhaustive search infeasible or impossible.
Thus, Bayesian Optimization, which utilizes the historical data as prior knowledge, fits
a probabilistic surrogate function and suggests a new candidate likely to improve the
modeling of the objective function for evaluation according to the posterior, could help
researchers find optimal designs faster.
In Bayesian Optimization, Gaussian Process is the commonly used surrogate mod
el to
model the objective function by incorporating knowledge of the previously evaluated
data instances. While selecting the next experiment(s) to evaluate, to balance the
probability of exploiting near the current optimal design and exploring in the regi on
with the greatest uncertainty, utility functions are often applied. Upper Confidence
Bound (UCB) is one of the most commonly used utility function s , which primarily
favors exploration, but switches to favor ing exploitation around the current optimal
des ign as gaining more information elsewhere it has explored. In each iteration, the
experimental design(s) with the highest utility will be selected to evaluate next.
*  **Active learning**

Active learning aims to train machine learning models more efficiently. Instead of
requiring all training data to be labeled beforehand, active learning starts with a small
training set, and interactively queries labels for more instances in the region of the
design space where the model is most uncertain. Wh en training a regression model in
an active learning way, the model should be able to estimate the uncertainty of the
unlabeled data and to model the unknown function with decent variability and less
bias (eg. a simple linear regression model may have too much bias and fail to model
the complexity of the black box function). Thus, a Gaussian Process regression model
seems to be a very good fit in this scenario.

## Related Work
* **Datasets**


**1. Protein Directed Evolution (DE)**

In the study published by
Wu et al. the researchers aimed to find the mutant of
the protein GB1 with the highest “fitness” (a measurement of t he protein’s stability
and functionality) by mutating the amino acid at four positions in its protein
sequence. There are 20 possible amino acids at each loc us in theory, but because
of experimental constraints, the researchers were not able to produce all 20 4
variants, but only 149,361 of them. The fitness scores for the mutant are relative
to the original wild type protein, meaning only those with fitness score s > 1 are
considered beneficial. And it was found that only 2.4% of the mutants are
beneficial.

In the paper published by Frisby and Langmead,Frisby and Langmead, ((2020)2020), the researchers performed, the researchers performed
Bayesian Optimization on this dataset, and sho
Bayesian Optimization on this dataset, and showed that within the budget of 191 wed that within the budget of 191 evaluations, the average maximum fitness found was about 5.3. Theevaluations, the average maximum fitness found was about 5.3. The mean and mean and median fitness in the DE dataset are 0.08 and 0.003, respective. median fitness in the DE dataset are 0.08 and 0.003, respective.


**2.	Buffer Composition** 
A cell-free system is an in vitro system allowing researche rs to examine biological
processes. While performing the experiments using this tool, the buffer
composition can cause variation in the production efficiency of the system. In the
study by Borkowski et al. al., they aimed to optimize the yield of a specific protein by
tuning the concentration of 11 differen t substances in the buffer and t o train a
regression model in an active learning fashion to predict the yield of specific buffer
compositions.

Their results show
that by training the committee regression model using active
lea rning with a budget of 510 evaluations, the r<sup>2</sup> of the model on the rest of the
data as the testing set reached ~0.6.

* **Applications**
I did not find any publicly available web application for active learning and Bayesian
Optimization on the internet. Together wit h a new Bayesian Optimization algorithm
named PROTOCOL (PaRallel OptimizaTiOn for ClOud developed in the
research group I worked in, a shiny based web application for performing BO tasks is
about to be published. That app was designed for Bay esian Optimization, and uses
Membership Query Synthesis strategy, such that the algorithm can synthesize any new
experiment designs within the searching space for the users to evaluate.

## Methods
The models for both tasks are implemented by the modAL and sc
i kit learn packages.
There are no criteria for the performance of the model to be considered as good,
because the expectation may vary drastically in different fields of research and types
of experiment. It depends on the users’ field specific knowledge t o decide when to
stop the iterative optimization process.


* **Active Regression**

The regression model used in this app is a Gaussian Process (GP) model with a Radial Basis Function kernel. The criteria used to select non-evaluated designs for evaluation is the uncertainty of the predictions (standard deviation at those points in the Gaussian Distribution) made by the GP model trained on previously known data. In each iteration, new designs of the batch size specified by the user will be given by the application for the user to run further experiments accordingly and provide labels/measurements for them later. The performance measurement of the model is the r<sup>2</sup> on its training data, and it’s updated after each time newly evaluated instances are incorporated.


* **Bayesian Optimization**


The surrogate model is a GP model with a Matern kernel. The Upper Confidence Bound utility function is applied, and instances of the batch size specified by the user with the highest UCB scores are returned for further evaluation. The performance measurement in this case is simply the highest objective value seen so far in the evaluated experiments.

## Results
* **User Interface Design**
The user interface consists of two parts: the sidebar for settings, and the main body
for performing the it erative model training or optimization.

In the sidebar, the user will first select whether they want to perform “Regression
model training” or “Objective optimization”. Then the text files containing evaluated
experiments and a pool of unlabeled instance s need to be uploaded. Finally, the “Fit
the model” button will call corresponding functions to initialize the models using the
uploaded data.

In the main body, there are three columns: **1) Left:** batch size selection, all labeled data that has been learned by the model, current performance (r<sup>2</sup> or maximum objective); **2) Middle:** a scatter plot of all data instances in the unlabeled pool projected on the first 2 principal components, colored according to their utility (for Bayesian Optimization) or uncertainty (for Active Regression) level; **3) Right:** a new batch of parameter designs to be evaluated, text input for the objective values of the new experiments, a button for retraining the model and updating the labeled and unlabeled pool.

* **Workflow**
While performing the tasks using the app, the users will follow the flow in the diagram below. The task type and data need to be specified and uploaded in the sidebar before beginning the model training or optimization process. Once the task has begun, the user will be in the loop of the iterative training/optimization process with 3 steps. They can request a certain number of new parameter designs, enter the objective values for the new batch, update the model and data pool, and decide whether to performance more experiments according to the current performance of the model.

* **Performance**
In order to test the app, I performance Bayesian Optimization on the protein directed
evolution dataset to find the protein mutants with higher f itness and Active Regression
on the buffer composition dataset to predict the yield of the cell free system with
certain compositions.

As shown in the table below, the model was initialized with 100 randomly selected
instances from the pool, and in each s ubsequent iteration, 20 new designs were
queried. It can be seen that as performing more experiments according to the
suggestions by the BO algorithm, the best objective value has increased from 1.90 to
4.43 after 5 batches.
